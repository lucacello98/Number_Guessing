Description:
A simple number guessing game implemented in Python where the player has to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low and allows the player a limited number of attempts based on the difficulty level.

Features:
Random Number Generation: The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
Guess Feedback: The program provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Difficulty Levels: Players can choose between easy and hard difficulty levels, which affect the number of guesses allowed.
Game Over Logic: The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

How It Works:
Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the program.
Player's Turn: The player is prompted to guess a number.
Feedback: The program will inform the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Remaining Attempts: The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number. The number of attempts is determined by the difficulty level:
    - Easy: 10 turns
    - Hard: 5 turns
Game End: The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
